# CASE_STUDY_BIKE_RENTAL
This project analyzes bike-sharing usage patterns to identify key trends and provide data-driven recommendations. In the project I used Chat GPT 4.0 to formulate better code in R and solve encountered problems.

## 📌 Key Insights
- 📊 **Trip duration:** Customera take significantly longer rides on average than Subscribers(Annual memebers).
- ⏰ **Peak Hours:** High usage occurs during commuting times (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM).
- 👥 **User Behavior:** Customers (Casual users) rent less frequently but spend more per ride.
- ⏰ **Peak Days:** Subscribers primarly use bikes for work commutes. Customers ride more frequently on weekends.
